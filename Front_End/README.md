This is the third module of the IBM course and covers the use of HTML/CSS and Javascript
</h2>
<ol>
<li>I started off just experimenting with the use of different elements in the first steps in html file. I also used this as an opportunity to set up my coding environment on VSCode and got used to using github through the terminal etc.</li>
<li>In the Interest Calculator and Unit Conversions, I used some elementary javascript along with HTML and CSS to create some simple apps. This is the first time I've used javascript and shortly after completing these I did a more itensive course on sololearn to improve my Javascript knowledge.</li>
<li>The final project in this module was the portfolio. This uses the skills acquired to create a resume like document. The general template was provided to us but we were tasked to personalise this and to add the capability of adding recomendations, for example the onClick functionality.</li>
