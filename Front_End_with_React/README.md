This is the fourth module of the IBM course and covers the use of react to create front end web apps.

<ul>
<li>The first hands on lab is the content rating project. Here I was provided with the css and the basic javascript and XML. I worked through the addition of the like and dislike buttons, learning how to handle events. I then had to add the fucntionality of the total button myself. I originally did it in a way that wouldn't dyanmically update, this was a key takeaway of this project. It is important to ensure any dynamic fucntionality needs to be properly added such that it dynamically updates.</li>
<li>The second lab was the event planner app. Again the structure of the static html and css were provided. I had to create the footer file, code up the component and then add it into the main file. This was to practice component composition.</li>
<li> The third lab we created a too do list app. This utilised  event handling and the manipulation of states. This was by far the most technical lab we have done so far and presented many challenges. The number of fucntions used and the denseness of syntax meant I had to spend a long time working out exactly what each function did and the order in which things were called as the user interacted with the webpage.</li>
<li> The fourth lab was the custom hook project. This was a quick lab showing the benefits of creating a custom hook. We have two components that both rely on fetching data from an external API. To ensure I don't have to write out the code for fetching the data in both components, we create a custom hook called useFetch. this then handles all the fetching of the API, leaving me to render the elements nicely, thus improving efficiency, readability and adaptability.</li>
<li> The fifth lab was the eCommerce project. This uses multiple components and redux to pass the states between them. This was a hugely rewarding project which, though complex, I felt I was able to get to grips with it well. In fact, the code they gave us in the tutorial had a few bugs in it. They used a different logic to disable the buttons once they were added to basket. I found this to not only be more complex, but it also didn't work brilliantly as the button wouldn't reenable when the item was removed from basket. Thus I was able to rework this to increase fucntionality.</li>
