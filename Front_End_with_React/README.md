This is the fourth module of the IBM course and covers the use of react to create front end web apps.

<ol>
<li>The first hands on lab is the content rating project. Here I was provided with the css and the basic javascript and XML. I worked through the addition of the like and dislike buttons, learning how to handle events. I then had to add the functionality of the total button myself. I originally did it in a way that wouldn't dynamically update, this was a key takeaway of this project. It is important to ensure any dynamic functionality needs to be properly added such that it dynamically updates.</li>
<li>The second lab was the event planner app. Again the structure of the static html and css were provided. I had to create the footer file, code up the component and then add it into the main file. This was to practice component composition.</li>
<li> The third lab we created a to do list app. This utilised  event handling and state manipulation. This was by far the most technical lab we have done so far and presented many challenges. The number of functions used and the denseness of syntax meant I had to spend a long time understanding the order and utility of the functions employed.</li>
<li> The fourth lab was the custom hook project. This was a quick lab showing the benefits of creating a custom hook. A custom hook useFetch was created to streamline the fetching of data from an API. As I worked with a couple of components requiring this capability, the custom hook increased efficiency and readability.</li>
<li> The fifth lab was the eCommerce project. This uses multiple components and redux to pass the states between them. This was a hugely rewarding project which, though complex, I felt I was able to get to grips with well. In fact, the code they gave us in the tutorial had a few bugs in it. For example, I streamlined the logic to disable the buttons, and extended the functionality to reenable when the item was removed from basket.</li>

<h3 style="font-size: 2em;">Final Project: https://Joeladams02.github.io/PlantShop</h3>
<p>I developed the PlantShop which is currently to be found in a seperate repository,to be accessible via gh-pages. This was majority coded by me, with the CSS and skeleton HTML provided. I added the button functionality throughout. I would be interested in further looking into the use of multi-page apps, as this one partly is.</p>
