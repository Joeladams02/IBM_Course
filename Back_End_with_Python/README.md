This is the sixth module of the IBM course and covers the use of python and flask to create back end web apps.

<li>The first lab I completed was a HTTP rquest from a wikipedia article to practice web scraping. I used pandas to read the table on the website and extract the important information, and then wrote it to a local file.</li>
<li>Next I used flask to create a simple RESTful API which handled add, posts and a delete. Included within this was appropriate error handling and parsing of data.</li>
<li>The next project involved creating the app.py for a transactions web app. This meant putting together the CRUD capabilities, whilst for the first time combining this with rendered templates and redirects meaning the app functioned as a multipage web app for the first time in this course.</li>
