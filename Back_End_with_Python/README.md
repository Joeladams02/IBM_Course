<li>The first lab I completed was a HTTP rquest from a wikipedia article to practice web scraping. I used pandas to read the table on the website and extract the important information, and then wrote it to a local file.</li>
<li>Next I used flask to create a simple RESTful API which handled add, posts and a delete. Included within this was appropriate error handling and parsing of data.</li>

<h3 style="font-size: 2em;">Final Project: https://Joeladams02.github.io/PlantShop</h3>
<p>I developed the PlantShop which is currently to be found in a seperate repository,to be accessible via gh-pages. This was majority coded by me, with the CSS and skeleton HTML provided. I added the button functionality throughout. I would be interested in further looking into the use of multi-page apps, as this one partly is.</p>
