This is the fifth module of the IBM Course and covers the server side with node.js and express</h2>
<ul>
<li>The first lab completed in this module was the first server with node project. In the http_server folder of the CD220labs I worked on the index-with-require.js file, along with the today.js file. This project introduced me to using the http package to listen and respond to http requests. I created a local server on port 8080 and then returned to the user a greeting message dependent upon the time of day it was. this also practiced creating a module of our own (today.js) and importing it's functionality into the main index file.</li>
