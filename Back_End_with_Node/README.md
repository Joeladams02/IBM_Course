This is the fifth module of the IBM Course and covers the server side with node.js and express</h2>
<ol>
<li>The first lab completed in this module was the first server project. In the http_server folder of the CD220labs I worked on the index-with-require.js file, along with the today.js file. This project introduced me to using the http package to listen and respond to http requests. I created a local server on port 8080 and then returned to the user a greeting message dependent upon the time of day it was. this also practiced creating a module of our own (today.js) and importing it's functionality into the main index file.</li>
<li> Secondly, I practiced some asynchronous code in the promises project. The first half of the code used the promises and nested .then to ensure the two functions execute concurrently, but are logged in the correct order. The second half of the script uses the async/await syntax. THis provides a more readable way of writing the same fucntionality.</li>
